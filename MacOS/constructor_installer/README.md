# Constructor-based PKG Installer

A hybrid approach to creating macOS PKG installers that combines conda constructor for Python environments with custom VSCode packaging, eliminating Homebrew dependency.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS development environment
- Conda/Miniconda installed
- Constructor package: `conda install constructor`
- Xcode command line tools

### Current Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed roadmap

#### Phase 1: Python Stack (In Progress)
- [ ] Constructor configuration
- [ ] Build automation
- [ ] Test integration

#### Phase 2: VSCode Component (Planned)
- [ ] VSCode packaging
- [ ] Extension management
- [ ] CLI integration

#### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Planned)
- [ ] Component integration
- [ ] Test suite adaptation
- [ ] Performance validation

#### Phase 4: Distribution Package (Planned)
- [ ] Unified installer
- [ ] Professional UI
- [ ] Error handling

#### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration (Planned)
- [ ] Automated builds
- [ ] Release pipeline
- [ ] Production deployment

## Usage (When Complete)

### Building Individual Components

```bash
# Build Python stack component
cd python_stack/
./build.sh

# Build VSCode component  
cd ../vscode_component/
./build_vscode_pkg.sh

# Build combined installer
cd ../distribution/
./build_combined.sh
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test Python stack
cd python_stack/
./test.sh

# Integration tests
cd ../testing/
./integration_tests.sh
```

## Benefits of Constructor Approach

1. **Offline Installation** - Python packages bundled, no internet required
2. **Version Consistency** - Exact same environment every time
3. **No Homebrew** - Eliminates complex dependency chain
4. **Professional Packaging** - Proper macOS PKG installers
5. **Enterprise Ready** - Single installer for managed deployments

## Comparison to Current System

| Aspect | Current System | Constructor System |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Internet Required | Yes (always) | No (after build) |
| Installation Time | ~10-15 minutes | ~3-5 minutes |
| Failure Points | Many (Homebrew, network, etc.) | Few (pre-validated) |
| Version Consistency | Variable | Exact |
| Enterprise Deployment | Complex | Simple |

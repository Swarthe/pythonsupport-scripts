### `run.sh`

Main diagnostics script that performs all system checks.

- Homebrew installation status

**Output:**

- Detailed system report
- Compatibility warnings
- Outputs to a temporary file in home directory

## Usage

Run before any installation to identify potential issues:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/main/MacOS/Components/Diagnostics/run.sh)"
```

## Integration

- Used within the GUI to check system compatibility before installation and to check if the installation was successful.
- Output file integrated into GUI mail-to functionality
